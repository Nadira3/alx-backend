# 0x00 Pagination Project

This repository contains the **0x00-pagination** project, which focuses on implementing pagination in backend systems. Pagination is essential for handling large datasets and optimizing API performance by serving data in manageable chunks.

## Project Description

In this project, we implement pagination to handle large sets of data more efficiently. By dividing content into pages, we can improve the user experience and server performance. This project demonstrates how to:

- Set up paginated API endpoints
- Use limit and offset for page control
- Implement response metadata to indicate pagination status (e.g., current page, total pages)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of pagination in web applications and APIs
- Implement basic pagination logic using parameters like `page`, `limit`, `offset`
- Optimize pagination for performance and user experience

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask (or another Python-based web framework if specified)
- **Database:** SQLite or any other relational database (for demo purposes)
- **Tools:** Postman (for API testing), Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x00-pagination.git
   cd 0x00-pagination
   ```

2. Create a Virtual Environment

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Set Up the Database

If the project uses a database, create and populate it with sample data.


5. Run the Application

```
python app.py
```


## Usage

With the application running, you can test the pagination endpoints using tools like Postman or your browser. Example usage with query parameters:
```
GET /items?page=2&limit=10
```
This will return items on page 2 with a limit of 10 items per page.

## Examples

Example endpoint response with pagination:

    ```
    {
      "data": [
        { "id": 11, "name": "Item 11" },
        { "id": 12, "name": "Item 12" },
        ...
      ],
      "pagination": {
        "current_page": 2,
        "total_pages": 5,
        "total_items": 50,
        "items_per_page": 10
      }
    }
    ```

## Pagination Parameters

- page: The current page number

- limit: Number of items per page

- offset (optional): Number of items to skip before starting to collect the result set
