## Project Description

The ALX Backend repository includes a series of modules, assignments, and exercises to develop and hone backend development skills. This project aims to provide foundational knowledge in backend technologies and concepts, including:

- RESTful APIs and best practices
- Database models, schema design, and SQL queries
- Authentication, Authorization, and Security best practices
- Caching mechanisms and performance optimization
- Asynchronous programming
- Debugging and testing in backend development

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks:** Flask, Django (optional, depending on the specific modules)
- **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (based on the module requirements)
- **Caching:** Redis, Memcached
- **API:** REST API principles
- **Others:** Docker (for containerization), Postman (for API testing), Git (version control)

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend.git
   cd alx-backend
   ```

2. Create a Virtual Environment

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```


3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python libraries specified in requirements.txt:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


4. Set Up the Database

Follow the specific database setup instructions for each module.


5. Run the Application

Run the application server depending on the specific framework/module you are working on:

python app.py  # or manage.py runserver for Django



## Usage

Use Postman or any API client to test endpoints.

Refer to the documentation within each module for endpoint details and sample requests.


## Project Structure

The repository structure is organized by module:
